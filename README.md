In this Pthon course I completed 10 labs. The scenario for this activity is Module 4 lab 2 and focuses on lab tasks 2 to 7.

### Module 1: Automate cybersecurity tasks with Python
##### Lab 1 Activity: Practice writing Python code
In this lab I became familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments in Python, and displaying strings with the print() function.

Tasks in this lab:
- Learn about the capabilities of a notebook environment
- Write code comments in Python
- Display strings with the print() function
##### Lab 2 Actvity: Assign Python variables
In this lab I created variables to keep track of information relevant to the login process for approved users to log in to a specific device.

Tasks in this lab:
- Assign variables of various data types
- Use the type() function to return a variable's data type
##### Lab 3 Activity: Create a conditional statement
In this lab I practiced applying conditional statements to automate processes across an organization.

Tasks in this lab:
- Write code that determines if a userâ€™s operating system requires an update
- Write code that determines if login attempts were made by approved users and if login attempts occurred during organization hours
##### Lab 4 Activity: Create loops
In this lab I practiced creating loops to automate repetitive processes and make them more efficient.

Tasks in this lab:
- Create a simple loop related to connecting to a network
- Utilize a for loop to investigate login activity by comparing a list of allowed IP addresses with a list of IP addresses from which users have tried to log in
- Use a while loop to generate unique employee IDs by iterating through numbers

### Module 2: Automate cybersecurity tasks with Python
##### Lab 1 Activity: Define and call a function
In this lab I defined and called functions to automate a series of tasks.

Tasks in this lab:
- Define and call a function that displays an alert about a potential security issue
- Define and call a function that iterates through a list of approved usernames and converts it into a string
##### Lab 2 Activity: Create more functions
In this lab I used built-in functions to work with a list of failed login attempts per month. I also defined a function that will help me analyze login attempts.

Tasks in this lab:
- Apply the built-in functions max() and sorted() to a list of failed login attempts
- Define a function that compares the logins for the current day to an average
- Return information from the function that you created

### Module 3: Automate cybersecurity tasks with Python
##### Lab 1 Activity: Work with strings in Python
In this lab I practiced creating Python code involving strings related to employee IDs, device IDs, and URLs.

Tasks in this lab:
- Use the str() and len() functions and to concatenate string data related to employee IDs
- Use bracket notation to extract components of a device ID
- Use bracket notation and the .index() method to extract components of a URL
##### Lab 2 Activity: Develop an algorithm
In this lab I wrote an algorithm that connects users to their assigned devices.

Tasks in this lab:
- Use the .append() and .remove() methods to manage a list of users and a list of user devices
- Indicate if a user is approved to access the system
- Work with indices and the .index() method to determine if a specific device corresponds to a specific user
##### Lab 3 Activity: Use regular expressions to find patterns
In this lab I created regular expression patterns and functions to extract important information from strings.

Tasks in this lab:
- Extract device IDs containing certain characters from a log
- Extract all IP addresses from a log and compare them to IP addresses flagged on a list

### Module 4: Automate cybersecurity tasks with Python
##### Lab 1 Activity: Import and parse a text file
In this lab I prepared a security log file for analysis and create a text file with IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted information.

Tasks in this lab:
- Import and store a text file as a string
- Convert the text file into a list using the string .split() method
- Append information to the text file
- Create another text file
##### Lab 2 Activity: Create another algorithm
In this lab I developed a new algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and removes addresses that no longer have access.

Tasks in this lab:
- Import a text file containing an allow list and store it as a string
- Develop a parsing algorithm that removes IP addresses that no longer have access to restricted information from the allow list
##### Lab 3 Activity: Debug Python code
In this lab I utilized debugging skills to identify errors in code and resolve them so that the code achieves the desired outcome.

Tasks in this lab:
- Apply debugging strategies to ensure code works properly
- Adjust code to resolve syntax errors, exceptions, and logic errors
