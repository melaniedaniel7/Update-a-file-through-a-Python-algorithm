# Algorithm for file updates in Python
Disclaimer:

### Project description
In this scenario I was a security analyst at a health care company. The company has a file that
only authorized employees can access. The authorized employees are identified by their IP addresses
and it is my job to keep this file up to date. I use a Python algorithm to keep this file up-to-date
and automate the process of parsing the file.

The algorithm I have developed parses the text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing 
IP addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.

Parsing a file allows security analysts to read and update the contents. 
An important part of cybersecurity and my job as a security professional 
is controlling access to restricted content.

### Open the file that contains the allow list

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish 
this in the Open the file that contains the allow list section of the 
Algorithm for file updates in Python template.

### Read the file contents

### Convert the string into a list

### Iterate through the remove list

### Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list

### Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses
