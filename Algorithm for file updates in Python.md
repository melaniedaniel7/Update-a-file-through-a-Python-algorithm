### Project description
In this scenario I was a security analyst at a health care company. The company has a file that
only authorized employees can access. The authorized employees are identified by their IP addresses
and it is my job to keep this file up to date. I use a Python algorithm to keep this file up-to-date
and automate the process of parsing the file.

The algorithm I have developed parses the text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing 
IP addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.

Parsing a file allows security analysts to read and update the contents. 
Parsing is the process of converting data into a more readable format.
An important part of cybersecurity and my job as a security professional 
is controlling access to restricted content.

Below are the steps I followed to create this algorithm.

### Open the file that contains the allow list
The file that I want to open is called `"allow_list.txt"`. 
I start by assigning a string containing this file name to the `import_file` variable. 
Then, I use a `with` statement to open it.
The keyword `with` handles errors and manages external resources. 
The `open()` function opens a file in Python.
I use the variable `file` to store the file while I work with it inside the `with` statement.
The purpose of opening the file is to allow me to access the IP addresses stored in the allow list file.

ðŸ’¡ `"r"` indicates that I want to read the file.

ðŸ’¡ The `as` keyword assigns a variable that references another object. When you open a file using `with open()`, you must provide a variable that can store the file while you are within the `with` statement. You can do this through the keyword `as` followed by this variable name.

### Read the file contents
Next, I use the `.read()` method to convert the contents of the allow list file into a string so that I can read them.
The `.read()` method converts files into strings. 
This is necessary in order to use and display the contents of the file that was read.
I store this string in a variable called `ip_addresses`.
This code reads the contents of the `allow_list.txt` file in a string format
that allows me to later use the string to organize and extract data in my Python program.

### Convert the string into a list
In order to remove individual IP addresses from the allow list, the IP addresses need to be in a list format. 
Therefore, I use the `.split()` method to convert the `ip_addresses` string into a list.
The `.split()` method converts a string into a list. It separates the string based on a specified character that's passed into `.split()` as an argument. 
The purpose of spliting `ip_addresses` into a list is to make it easier to remove IP addresses from the allow list.
To store the list I reassigned it back to the variable `ip_addresses`.

### Iterate through the remove list
A second list called `remove_list` contains all of the IP addresses that should be removed from the `ip_addresses` list. 
I set up the header of a `for` loop that will iterate through the `remove_list`. 
The `for` loop is an iterative statement that iterates through the IP addresses (in this scenario).
I use `element` as the loop variable and the keyword `in`.
The keyword `in` indicates to iterate through the sequence `ip_addresses` and assign each value to the loop variable element.

### Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
In the body of my iterative statement, I add code that will remove all the IP addresses from the allow list that are also on the remove list. 
First, I create a conditional that evaluates if the loop variable `element` is part of the `ip_addresses` list. 
Then, within that conditional, I apply the `.remove()` method to the `ip_addresses` list and remove the IP addresses identified in the loop variable `element`.
The `.remove()` method is used to remove an element, which in this case is an IP address from the `remove_list`.
ðŸ’¡Applying the .remove() method in this way is possible because there are no duplicates in the ip_addresses list.

### Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses
Now that I have removed these IP addresses from the `ip_address` variable, I can complete the algorithm by updating the file with this revised list. 
To do this, I must first convert the `ip_addresses` list back into a string using the `.join()` method. 
I apply `.join()` and `"\n"`to the string in order to separate the elements in the file by placing them on a new line.
The `.join()` method concatenates the elements of an iterable into a string. 
Put simply, this means that it converts a list back into a string.
Then, I used another `with` statement and the `.write()` method to write over the file assigned to the `import_file` variable.
This way, the restricted content will no longer be accessible to any IP addresses that were removed from the allow list.
The `.write()` method writes string data to a specified file. 
ðŸ’¡You should use the `"w"` argument when you want to replace the contents of an existing file.

### Summary
In this scenario I created an algorithm that removes unauthorized IP addresses identied in a `remove_list` variable from the `"allow_list.txt"` file of approved IP addresses.
The algorithm opened the file, converting it to a string to be read, and then converting this string to a list stored in the variable `ip_addresses`. 
I then iterated through the IP addresses in `remove_list` with a `for` loop.
With each iteration, I evaluated if the element was part of the `ip_addresses` list. If it was, I applied the `.remove()` method to it to remove the element from `ip_addresses`. 
Finally, I used the `.join()` method to convert the `ip_addresses` back into a string so that I could write over the contents of the `"allow_list.txt"` file with the revised list of IP addresses.
